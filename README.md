<h1 align="center">Binary Classification Web App</h1>

This is a web app built to dynamically select a classifier from the given options along with their respective hyper-parameters and view the results in three formats.

The classifiers used:
* Support Vector Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier

The metrics used:
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Precision-Recall Curve

The web app was built using the **Streamlit** module.

The webpage was deployed on **Heroku**.

I also utilised Streamlit Sharing to automatically host my web app on their server without the need of external shell scripting and other procedures required for hosting a website on heroku.
